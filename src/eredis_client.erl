%% eredis_client
%%
%% The client is implemented as a gen_server which keeps one socket
%% open to a single Redis instance. Users call us using the API in
%% eredis.erl.
%%
%% The client works like this:
%%  * When starting up, we connect to Redis with the given connection
%%     information, or fail.
%%  * Users calls us using gen_server:call, we send the request to Redis,
%%    add the calling process at the end of the queue and reply with
%%    noreply. We are then free to handle new requests and may reply to
%%    the user later.
%%  * We receive data on the socket, we parse the response and reply to
%%    the client at the front of the queue. If the parser does not have
%%    enough data to parse the complete response, we will wait for more
%%    data to arrive.
